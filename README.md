E-Commerce Platform Demo (Interview Task)

ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

This repository contains a single-page, multi-view React application simulating a foundational e-commerce platform. It is designed to demonstrate proficiency in:

React State Management and Routing (using react-router-dom).

External API Interaction (axios for JSON Server REST API).

Database Integration Simulation (Firestore for user-specific data like cart/wishlist).

Authentication Flow (Mocked Google/Firebase Auth for Users & Static Credentials for Admin).

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Admin functionality.

The application allows two primary user types: Customers (sign in via Google) and Administrators (static login).

ðŸš€ Step-by-Step Execution Guide

To ensure a smooth evaluation, please follow these two main setup stages.

Stage 1: Setting up the Mock Product API (JSON Server)

This project requires a mock backend to serve product data and handle order persistence via REST calls (http://localhost:5000).

Install JSON Server globally:

npm install -g json-server

Start the Server: Run the JSON Server from the directory containing db.json:

json-server --watch db.json --port 5000


Keep this terminal window open while running the application.

Stage 2: Running the React Frontend

Dependencies: Ensure you have necessary React dependencies (react, react-dom, react-router-dom, axios, and Tailwind CSS is assumed).

Run Application: Start the React development server.

npm start
